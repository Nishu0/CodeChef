# Chef Loves 1010

Chef is given a binary string S of length N. As Chef loves 1010 and he is busy in the preparation of Christmas, 
he asks you to count the maximum number of continuous substrings 1010, 
which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the given string.

As a reminder, a binary string is a string consisting only of 0's ans 1's.

## Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.
The first line of the test case contains an integer N - the length of the binary string.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string S.
## Output Format
For each test case, print maximum number of continuous substrings 1010, which Chef can get after reordering symbols in the string.

## Constraints
1≤T≤100\
2≤N≤100\
|S|=N\
S is a binary string

## Explanation
- Test case 1: There are no 0s in the string, so a 1010 substring is not possible.
- Test case 2: We can reorder string into 01010100, in which the first 1010 starts from index 2, 
and the second 1010 starts from index 4. It can be proven that there are no orderings that give the answer larger than 2.

# Solution
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int T;
	cin >> T;

	while(T--){
	    long long int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    string s;
	    cin>>s;
	    long long int ans=0;
	    long long int s1=0;
	    long long int s2=0;
	    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	        {
	            if(s[i]=='1')
	                {
	                    s1++;
	                }
	            else
	                {
	                    s2++;
	                }
	        }
	    ans = max(ans,min(s1,s2)-1);
	    cout<<ans<<"\n";
	}
	return 0;
}
```
